# water-quality-prediction
End-to-end ML project: water quality analysis, model training &amp; Flask web app for safe water prediction.
# 💧 Water Quality Prediction using XGBoost & Flask

This project is an **end-to-end Machine Learning application** that predicts the **potability of water** (whether water is safe for drinking) based on chemical properties.  
The model is trained using **XGBoost Classifier** (highest accuracy among tested models) and deployed using **Flask** with a simple web interface.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing & cleaning (handling missing values)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Model training using multiple ML algorithms
- Final deployment with **XGBoost (highest accuracy)**
- Flask-based web app for real-time predictions
- Styled frontend with background image & form

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is **Water Potability Dataset** (available on Kaggle).  
It contains water quality metrics such as:
- pH
- Hardness
- Solids
- Chloramines
- Sulfate
- Conductivity
- Organic Carbon
- Trihalomethanes
- Turbidity
- Potability (Target variable)
